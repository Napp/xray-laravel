# Aws X-Ray for Laravel

[![Latest Version on Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/napp/xray-laravel.svg?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/napp/xray-laravel)

The package automatically trace your laravel application and sends to [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray). 

## What is X-Ray?

X-Ray is a distributed tracing system for production apps. AWS X-Ray traces user requests as they travel through your entire application. 
It aggregates the data generated by the individual services and resources that make up your application, providing you an end-to-end view of how your application is performing. 

## X-Ray for Laravel

This package enables automatic tracing of important parts of your application, such as http request, database queries, views and queue jobs. Those parts are being traced and sent to AWS X-Ray for you to improve performance. 

Below is a simple example of a http request with a database query. This query is quite slow and could maybe be optimized or cached.

Each element has extra information, such as the database query stack trace.

## Installation

1. Install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require napp/xray-laravel
```

2. Add middleware to the top of the global middleware in `App\Http\Kernel.php`.

```php
protected $middleware = [
    \Napp\Xray\Middleware\RequestTracing::class, // here

    \App\Http\Middleware\TrustProxies::class,
    \App\Http\Middleware\CheckForMaintenanceMode::class,
    // ...
];
```

3. Add XrayServiceProvider to the very top of providers in `config/app.php`. 

```php
'providers' => [
    /*
     * Laravel Framework Service Providers...
     */
    Napp\Xray\XrayServiceProvider::class, // here

    Illuminate\Auth\AuthServiceProvider::class,
    Illuminate\Broadcasting\BroadcastServiceProvider::class,
    // ...
];
```

Optionally, you can add the facade in `config/app.php`. 

```php
'aliases' => [
    // ...
    'Xray' => \Napp\Xray\Facades\Xray::class,
],
```

4. Edit the AWS Execution role to include X-Ray permissions.

Either add the preexisting policy from AWS `AWSXrayWriteOnlyAccess`, or create your own:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "xray:PutTraceSegments",
                "xray:PutTelemetryRecords",
                "xray:GetSamplingRules",
                "xray:GetSamplingTargets",
                "xray:GetSamplingStatisticSummaries"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

5. Head over to AWS Console, to Lambda and find your function. Activate X-Ray Tracing.

## Manually use the Tracer

Lets say you want to trace a specific piece of your code to deeply understand the impact on performance.

```php
Xray::addSegment('MyCustomLogic');

// run your code

Xray::endSegment('MyCustomLogic');
```

Another use case is to inspect some heavy php side parsing of data.

```php
use Napp\Xray\Facades\Xray;

class XMLParser
{
    public function handle($file)
    {
        // adding some metadata to the segment
        Xray::addSegment('XMLParser', null, [
            'file' => $file->name()
        ]);
        $this->parse($file);
        Xray::endSegment('XMLParser');
    }
    
    private function parse($xml): array 
    {
        Xray::addSegment('XMLParser parse');
        $output = $this->getAttributeList();
        // some more code
        Xray::endSegment('XMLParser parse');

        return $output;
    }
    
    private function getAttributeList(): array 
    {
        Xray::addSegment('XMLParser getAttributeList');
        // your code
        Xray::endSegment('XMLParser getAttributeList');

        return [];
    }
}
```

The above results in:

## Daemon support

The X-Ray daemon is automatically run in a Lambda environment. Use this over the default `Napp\Xray\Submission\APISegmentSubmitter` to relay requests to Amazon X-Ray.

Firstly, publish the X-Ray config and then update the submitter in `config/xray.php` to `\Napp\Xray\Submission\DaemonSegmentSubmitter::class`

```console
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=xray-config
```

```php
# config/xray.php
...
 'submitter' => \Napp\Xray\Submission\DaemonSegmentSubmitter::class,
...
```

The daemon submitter will pick up the `_AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS` `_AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_PORT`. These environment variables are injected for you if using a service like [Laravel Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com/)

## Disable Tracer

If you want to disable the Tracer, just add to the `.env` file.

```dotenv
XRAY_ENABLED=false
```
